\# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis



In this Data Analytics project, I explored the Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster Dataset from \[Kaggle].  

The goal was to clean the dataset, analyze survival patterns, and visualize insights using Python.

\## Key Insights

\- \*\*Gender\*\*: Females had significantly higher survival rates than males.  

\- \*\*Class\*\*: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 2nd and 3rd class.  

\- \*\*Age\*\*: Younger passengers had better chances of survival.  

\- \*\*Fare\*\*: Higher fare passengers generally had higher survival rates.
